        As a subordinate manager and a drone pilot on the mine, I was tasked
        with ensuring the safety and legality of blasting operations. I filmed
        and processed data from the drone flights to provide information for
        upper management to make long-term decisions regarding the mine. As a
        representative on behalf of the drone company, I dealt with all
        communication and financial matters.
