# skye-website

I build this website to display my proffiecieny in web-development.

The site is built using React.JS for the front end and the ASP .Net framework for the back end.

To show an understanding of APIs the download button for the CV does not download a file stored on the same server. The front end retrieves the PDF through an API from an Azure blob.
